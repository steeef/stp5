[^1]: This keyboard originally came with Cherry MX Browns, but I swapped them out for older MX Clears that I scavenged from a Cherry point-of-sale keyboard, G80-8113HRBUS-2.
[^2]: More like 1.5, as one of them is non-functional. I attemted to solder in a USB adapter, but haven't had a chance to figure out where it's shorting out.
