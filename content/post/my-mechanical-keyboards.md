## Current Inventory

Here's a current list of the keyboards I've acquired and their switches.

* Realforce 87u Tenkeyless: **Topre 45g**
* Matias Ergo Pro: **Matias Quiet Click**
* Filco Majestouch Tenkeyless: **Cherry MX Blue**
* KBC Poker: **Cherry MX Old Clears[^1]**
* HPE 87: **Cherry MX Red**
* TG3 BLT: **Cherry MX Black**
* WASD v2 87 Keyboard: **Cherry MX White**
* Two IBM Model-Ms[^2]: **Buckling Spring**

[^1]: This keyboard originally came with Cherry MX Browns, but I swapped them out for older MX Clears that I scavenged from a Cherry point-of-sale keyboard, G80-8113HRBUS-2.
[^2]: More like 1.5, as one of them is non-functional. I attemted to solder in a USB adapter, but haven't had a chance to figure out where it's shorting out.
