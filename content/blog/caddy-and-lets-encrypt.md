*Note: this is a follow-up to my earlier post on setting up Caddy with Docker,
which is [here]({{<relref "post/docker-hugo-caddy.md" >}}).*

I've just enabled Caddy's Automatic HTTPS function, which leverages [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate a key and get a signed
certificate as soon as the server starts up. It's free and simple. Awesome!

I was able to figure this out by reading the official documetation on
Automatic HTTPS[^1] and Abiola Ibrahim's example Dockerfile for Caddy, which
included a nice section on how to persist the `.caddy` directory[^2].
